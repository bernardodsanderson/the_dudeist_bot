There is a saying among soldiers:
Fighting in the desert is much different than canopy jungle.
Choose your battles carefully.
In this way, one makes the handoff without taking the hill,
Draws a line in the sand without stepping over the line,
Overcomes obstacles without becoming bereaved,
And keeps what’s theirs without getting a man down.

Conversely, there is no bummer like getting your dick cut off.
Bush-league psych-out stuff can get you fucked in the ass.
When two bowling teams have got a date Wednesday, baby,
The unworried adversary
Is the one that will crack.

*Tao Te Ching*

There is a saying in the military:
Do not be the first to attack.
Rather, focus on holding your ground.
It is better to retreat a foot than to advance an inch.

This is called:
Advancing without movement,
Seizing without grasping,
Confronting without attacking,
And warding off without weaponry.

The greatest error is to disrespect an enemy—
Character is the greatest casualty of conceit.
Thus, when two equal armies collide,
It is the one which laments the need to do so
That is the more likely to triumph.
