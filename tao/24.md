Put your toe over the line,
That’s a foul.
Mark that frame an eight,
You’re entering a world of pain.
Flash your piece out on the lanes,
They’ll stick it up your ass.
Fuck with the Jesus,
You are nobody.
Don’t calm down,
And you will be asked to leave.
Threaten our basic freedoms,
And you will forfeit yours.
This prevents any delayed after-effects.

From the point of view of the Dude,
These actions are drags and bummers.
This is why he has to use so many cuss words.
Shit, man—
Don’t kidnap yourself.

**Tao Te Ching**

Stand on your tiptoes and you will fall over.
Overextend your stride and you will tire quickly.
Focus on yourself and you will never learn anything.
Sit stubbornly and you will never move forward.
Admire yourself and you will never be admired.
In this way, nature self-corrects itself,
And prevents the selfish from persevering.

From the point of view of the Tao,
Excessive and greedy actions are like tumors.
This is why people naturally detest them.
A follower of Tao rejects them as a matter of principle.
