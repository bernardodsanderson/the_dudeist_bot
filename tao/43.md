Those that abide,
In time, naturally overcome those that aggress.

The loser overcomes the achiever,
The bum comes over the heiress,
The lazy undermines the loaded,
The goldbricker outwits the gold-keyed.

From these examples we learn the value of taking it easy.
What the fuck are you talking about—
Unemployment can produce wealth?
That’s fucking interesting, man.

*Tao Te Ching*

The softest things in the world,
In time, naturally overcome the hardest.
The most formless things in the world,
In time, naturally overcome the most solid.

From these examples we can learn the value of not trying.
Of course, this can be very difficult to understand—
How it is that surrender can lead to success.
