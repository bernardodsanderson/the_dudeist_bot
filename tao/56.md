He who is wise does not blather,
While he who blathers usually has something to hide.

It’s all just, like, your opinion, man,
So keep your voice down,
And stay out of the preach communities.
There’s an unspoken message here—
It’s “Shut the fuck up!”

In shutting the fuck up,
Phoniness and aggression,
Satyriasis and nymphomania,
Strikes and gutters,
And even matters of life and death,
Will not affect you.
You’ll rest easy, good buddy, and make it to the finals.
Fuckin’ A.

**Tao Te Ching**

Those who are wise do not speak about wisdom,
And those who speak about wisdom are not wise.

Shut your mouth,
Close your eyes,
Blunt your edges,
Untie your knots,
Unwind your intellect,
And identify yourself with the dust.
This is how you achieve unity with the world.

Once unity with the world is achieved,
You will no longer be able to be attached, nor aloof,
Nor benefited, nor harmed,
Nor ennobled, nor disgraced.

This is the highest state of human development.
