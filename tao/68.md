A good bowler does not contravene bylaws,
A good lord imagines where it goes from here,
A good buddy rests easy,
A good man is thurrah,
A good story makes you laugh to beat the band,
A good burger is found in low places.
Avoiding conflict is the best way to have it your way, Dude.
And a good day to you, sir.

*Tao Te Ching*

The best warriors are not warlike.
The best pugilists are not pugnacious.
The best contenders are not contentious.
The best overlords do not lord themselves over.

This is called going with the flow of natureâ€”
It is the most effective approach toward governance,
Because it is aligned in accordance with Tao.
