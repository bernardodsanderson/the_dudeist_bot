A glass is made of crystal,
But it is the space at its center which lets it become a beverage.
A bowling ball is made of resin,
But it is the holes for your fingers which render it rollable.
A bungalow is made of plaster and plywood
But it is the open door which lets you inside.

Therefore, though it is stuff that people want,
It is space that people need.

*Tao Te Ching*

A wheel is fashioned from spokes,
Yet it is the emptiness at its hub which allows it to function.
A bowl is molded from clay,
Yet it is the hollow at its center which allows it to be used.
A house is structured from timber and stone
Yet it is the empty space within which affords it its value.

Therefore, although presence provides property,
Empty space affords utility.
