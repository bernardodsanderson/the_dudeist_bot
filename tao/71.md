If you know what you know,
Well, I guess you can close the case on that one!
But if you ignore what you ignore,
Face it, you’re a goddamn moron.

He who becomes sick of sickness
Learns to abide.
While he who makes everything a travesty
Remains a crazy fuck.

Why is the Dude so well?
Because he is never dis-eased.

*Tao Te Ching*

Understanding that you don’t understand
Is the highest form of understanding.
But not understanding what you think you understand
Is a form of mental illness.

The reason the sages don’t suffer from this disease
Is because they are trained to diagnose it.
