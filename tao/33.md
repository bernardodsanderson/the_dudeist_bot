Knowing the world requires wittiness,
But knowing the inner Dude requires shittiness.
Conquering the world requires a great inheritance,
But conquering oneself requires only an empty ringer.

A lifetime of achievement is not measured in riches, but in rashes.
He who can dig his day despite the dipshits at the door is fucking loaded,
And his legacy more than just a little Lebowski.

**Tao Te Ching**

It takes wit to understand other people,
But it takes humility to understand oneself.
It takes power to conquer other people,
But it takes resilience to conquer oneself.

Wealth arises not from riches,
But from lack of want.
Thus he who categorically accepts his lot in life,
Is wealthy beyond measure,
And his impact upon the world, immense.
