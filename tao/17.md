The best achievers are scarcely known by the bums.
The next best are compensated and given beepers.
The next best are real reactionaries who make things plain.
The very worst are human paraquatâ€”
They blame everything on the bums.
So the bums reveal them for the phonies they are.

When achievers accomplish more than most,
But without scamming anyone here,
The bums leave them alone, mister.

**Tao Te Ching**

The greatest rulers are barely known,
The next best are admired,
The next best are feared,
The next best are loathed.
The stronger the feelings, the weaker the trust,
And those who cannot trust, cannot be governed.

Thus, the best rulers take no credit for their achievements.
This makes the people feel that they have governed themselves.
