Nihilists are unsentimental,
They believe in nossing.
The Stranger is also unsentimental,
He drifts where the wind catches him.
Nihilists are like a bellows—
Empty, yet full of hot air.
The more they threaten, the more cowardly they seem.
The Stranger also rambles and loses his train of thought,
But tells a purty good story—
There’s a literal connection.
It affects all of us, dude.
There is no bottom.

*Tao Te Ching*

Nature is unsentimental –
It treats the living no different than it treats debris.
Sages are the same: They evaluate everyone impartially.

Nature is like a bellows—
It is empty and yet everything springs from it.
The more pressure put on it, the more it creates.
Man is not like this–
The more he produces, the more the more exausted he becomes.

To tap into the Tao, the sage instead turns inward.
There he finds its calm and creative source
At the very center of his being.
