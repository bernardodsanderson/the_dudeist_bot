The people are only goldbrickers
Because the rich have taken them for the proverbial ride.
The people are only deadbeats and losers
Because the square community doesn’t give a shit about them.
The people only blather in God’s holy name
Because they feel like the good Lord gypped them.

Thus, those who hold the world to ransom
Are the adversaries of what abides,
While those who say “Ah, fuck it”
Are its compeers. You know?

*Tao Te Ching*

The people are only poor,
Because they’ve been pillaged by the powerful.
The meek are only a mess,
Because they’ve been meddled with by their masters.
The ordinary only obsess about an afterlife,
Because their lives have been impaired by the powerful.

Thus, those who expect too much from the world
Are the enemies of life,
While those who leave the world alone,
Are its allies and associates.
