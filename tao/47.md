You can listen and learn something occasionally
Without leaving your private residence.
We can wait and watch something wonderful
Without having to pay another hundred.
The more you dig,
The more there is to be dug.

The Stranger wanders westward without a wagon,
Sees the stupefying without going to London or France,
And is cool without having to use cuss words.
Though he doesn’t find the angels to be that exactly,
They make him laugh to beat the band.

*Tao Te Ching*

The whole world can be understood
Without leaving your room.
The Way can be witnessed
Without opening your window.

The further one progresses,
The less one understands.

Therefore the sage:
Doesn’t look, yet perceives
Doesn’t seek, yet finds
Doesn’t try, yet does.
