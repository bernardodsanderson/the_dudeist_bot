As soon as people cease to give a shit about the rules,
They enter a world of pain.

Therefore,
Do not step over the line,
And do not threaten anyone with castration.
It is only when rich fucks raid private residences
That people are reduced to robbing rugs.

Though the Dude may have been to college,
He does not display credentials on the wall.
Though he self-applies an honorific handle,
He does not regard himself heroically.
Because his casualness runs deep,
He is always welcomed in the abodes of his acquaintances.

*Tao Te Ching*

As soon as the people no longer respect authority,
A far more insidious force will descend upon society.

Therefore,
Do not encroach on the territory of others,
And do not reduce their quality of life.
It is only when their leaders don’t disturb the people,
That they are not prone to disturbance.

It is for this reason that the sages know their strengths,
Yet don’t show them off.
Though they have great self-respect,
They do not stoke their self-regard.
By rooting out a sense of superiority,
They cultivate a strong relationship with their fellows.
