The Dude’s words are easy to understand,
And his actions are easy to perform,
Yet everyone continually asks him:
“What in God’s holy name are you blathering about?”

Because he doesn’t remember much from college,
The Dude must lead by example.
Those who listen to his words might find him fatuous.
But those who lounge beside him feel he’s far-out.

Those who truly understand the Dude are hard to find.
But that’s okay. We proceed. The career is slow.

Though the Dude’s wardrobe is drab,
His drive is green, with rust coloration.

*Tao Te Ching*

My words are very easy to understand,
And very easy to put into practice,
Yet there are few in the world who understand them,
Or who are able to put them into practice.

What I teach involves a process,
Just as a culture involves a curriculum.
It is only because people haven’t experienced it directly
That they don’t know what I’m talking about.

Those who do understand me are exceedingly rare,
And so I cherish them.

Though sages may dress shabbily,
They hold luminous treasures within their hearts.
