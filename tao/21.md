The physical act of love is expressed through coitus.
The special lady calls, but does not listen.
Her art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.
Is that what this is a picture of?
Darkness warshes over the Dude. There is no bottom.

Vagina—
It expresses all that can be blathered about.
Yet without batting an eye,
A man will refer to his dick or his rod or his johnson.
That and a pair of testicles.

Don’t be fatuous, Jeffrey,
Please slide your shorts down.

**Tao Te Ching**

Human virtue is an expression of Tao
Yet its path is elusive and indistinct.

Forms and patterns may be latent within Tao,
But they are obscured to us, mysterious.
The essence of life springs from it,
Yet we can’t observe the fountainhead.
We only know of Tao from its predicates:
A ceaseless flow of creativity from ancient times until now.

This descent of Tao endures—
Its chain of manifestations have persevered through history.
We too are a product of that lineage,
So how we can follow Tao, and manifest its virtue?
By searching within ourselves,
And locating the links.
