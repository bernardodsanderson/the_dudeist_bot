Why is bowling eternal?
Because it rolls in cycles.
Similarly, because he has no ends,
The Dude never fails to achieve.

The Dude takes it easy,
And so brother shamuses dig his work.
He says, “ah, fuck it”
And thus nothing is fucked.
Because he is a pacifist,
No harm is visited tenfold upon his head.
Because he does not put himself over the line,
He does not enter a world of pain.
It is only because he gives a shit about the fucking TOE,
That no one’s going to cut his dick off.

**Tao Te Ching**

Why is Nature eternal and enduring?
Because it does not have any ends.
Because it lacks any goals,
Nature can never fail to succeed.

Understanding this,
The sage also refuses to contend or compete.
By placing himself in the back,
He soon finds himself out in front.
Because he doesn’t have any expectations,
He doesn’t suffer any disappointments.
Thus, it is only because he lacks any self-interest
That his interests are fulfilled.
