When Dudeness is abandoned,
League bylaws and fucking rules take its place.

When political advocacy is dealt by pornographers,
Standards fall regrettably.

When you can no longer keep â€™em down on the farm,
Nihilist dipshits are dispatched as experts.

When the goddamn plane has crashed into the mountain,
Fucking fascists take over beach communities.

*Tao Te Ching*

When people abandon the Tao,
Doctrines of morality and rectitude take its place.

Once intellect and knowledge are esteemed,
Hypocrisy and pretense become routine.

As family relationships become strained,
We start to hear a lot about the importance of kinship.

And it is only when the whole political system is in trouble,
That ministers start preaching about patriotic loyalties.
