Too much Kahlua blunts the vodka
Too much vodka dilutes the milk
Too much milk dulls the beverage
Too much beverage maddens the mind,
Too much madness makes the whole world go fucking crazy!

A good burger provides for the belly, not for the head
In-N-Out, it pairs well with sarsaparilla.

*Tao Te Ching*

Too much light blinds the eye,
Too much sound deafens the ear,
Too much spice blunts the taste,
Too much excitement maddens the mind,
Too much desire compromises the character.

That is why the sage puts his inner needs first,
By moderating the external distractions of the senses.
