It is best to be like the Dude.
The Dude takes it easy, and is calmer than you are,
He hangs out in bowling alleys and other places
Where careers slow down a little.

So, be like the Dude:
Laying low, upon his rug,
Driving a car with rust coloration,
Helping his lady friend conceive,
Taking any rug in the house,
Patronizing the In-N-Out Burger on Camrose,
Digging your style too,
And ending this thing cheap.
In this way, life goes on,
And worry does not.

**Tao Te Ching**

It is best to be like water
Water benefits all things,
Yet it does not contend, nor struggle to do so.
Water naturally goes places shunned by most people,
Therefore water is very similar to Tao.
Because it dwells even in low places, it is of benefit to allâ€”
Even the unpopular and rejected.

Be like water:
Dwell low, close to the earth,
Penetrate deeply, and reflect serenely upon your environment,
Benefit and nourish all the things around you,
Communicate clearly and faithfully,
When taking charge, be appropriate,
When serving others, be able,
Do not rush nor tarry.
There is a unique time, rhythm and speed for every action.

The sage does not pit himself against Nature.
Therefore he never finds his path obstructed.
