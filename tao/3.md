There are rules.

So the Stranger inspires the Dude by:
Digging his style,
Listening to his story,
Telling him to take ’er easy,
And boosting his morale before the finals.

If people aren’t privy to the new shit that has come to light,
Cowards among them will threaten castration;
If no action is taken,
There will only be pee-stains on the rug.

*Tao Te Ching*

Exalting our superiors invites competition.
Treasuring things that are difficult to obtain encourages theft.
Flaunting objects of desire gives rise to jealousy.

So the sage rules by:
Relaxing the people’s hearts,
Satisfying their needs,
Lessening their wants,
And strengthening their character.

Once he has shown people how to live without craftiness and envy,
Cunning interlopers cannot take advantage of nor trick them.
Living without objective allows us to live in harmony with nature.
