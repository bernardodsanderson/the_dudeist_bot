The Dude knows that everything is just, like, his opinion, man.
He does not distinguish between Lenin and Lennon,
Marmots and Ferrets,
Pomeranians and Yorkshire Terriers,
Chinamen and Asian-Americans.
Dance quintets, cycles, and what-have-you.
He doesn’t draw lines in the sand.

He looks for the ones who will benefit,
But he doesn’t look for handouts.
He digs those who are a Lebowski.
He also digs those who are not a Lebowski.
That’s terrific.
He does business with those who are wrong.
He also does business with those who are not wrong,
But are just assholes.

He doesn’t want to be a hard-on about this.
He is in harmony with the world,
So he abides the worlds of others.
You know, it’s just a game, man.
Mark it ∞.
This affects all of us.

*Tao Te Ching*

The sage has no fixed ideas about anything,
So he takes in a broad range of information—
Not only from the admired,
But also from the shunned,
And so doubles the value he receives.
He entertains not only the credible,
But the incredible as well,
And so multiplies his libraries of learning.

In husbanding the world,
The sage draws people together
Into one big glorious mess.
In this way, he keeps them from maturing,
Preventing their perceptions from growing old and brittle.
