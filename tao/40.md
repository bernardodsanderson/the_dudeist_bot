The motion of the ball is a cycle.
The use of the ball is to knock pins down,
After which, they pop up again.
Bowling is made of motion,
And motion is made of nothing.
It’s all just a game, man.
Well, that’s your perception.

*Tao Te Ching*

Tao travels everywhere,
But always returns to its origin,
Though it gives rise to the world,
It does so with enormous gentleness and humility.
This is because it starts from nothing.
