When a plan gets too complex, everything can go wrong.
Do you see what happens?
Draw a line in the sand, toes will slip over the line.
Put a million dollars in your car, perhaps they’ll tow it.
Roll your way into the semis, they’re gonna fuck you up.
Take any rug in the house, you’ll get a crack on the jaw.
Keep the fucking money, they’re gonna cut off your johnson.

Instead, say “Fuck it.”
That’s your answer for everything.
It is the way of the Dude.

*Tao Te Ching*

Man is oriented toward excess,
But greed puts a strain on systems,
Destroying them.

An oversharpened blade will be broken
An overflowing vault will be vanquished
An overvalued ego will be brought down.

Do what is necessary, take what you need,
And then get out of the way.
This is the efficient way in which Nature operates.
