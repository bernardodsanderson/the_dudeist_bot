The Dude isn’t tied down,
Yet he leaves nothing untied together.
If the achievers could do the same,
Life would become a natural, zesty enterprise
And proud we’d be of all of them.

Not greedy,
All the Dude ever wanted was his rug back
And to just take it easy, man.
A peaceful easy feeling:
It’s down there somewhere, let me take another look.

*Tao Te Ching*

Tao doesn’t do anything,
And yet somehow it gets everything done.
If the mighty could also eschew objectives,
Everything in the world would naturally thrive.

When objectives assert themselves,
They can be subdued with simplicity.
Subdued by simplicity, tranquility is attained,
And the world once again thrives as it may.
