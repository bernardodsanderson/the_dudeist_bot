Relinquish the robe,
And help the special lady conceive.
Requisition the lane through which you roll your balls.
What is that, yoga?
Going down through the generations.

To know the new shit which has come to light,
Let darkness warsh over you.
The guttural balling,
The physical act of love.
Can you blow that far?

He knows it’s his fucking homework,
But doesn’t say peep.
Mixing the liquors,
He creates the cocktail.
Careful, man! There’s a beverage here!
The Dude loves limberly.
Wonderful womb man!
Very free-spirited.

*Tao Te Ching*

Respect power,
But maintain receptivity.
By being receptive, one lies underneath the world,
And protects the power of its undifferentiated potential.

To understand the brilliant,
One must also be steeped in the obscure.
By acting as a facilitator for the world,
One gains access to the world’s resources,
Along with its undifferentiated potential.

The sage understands glory and honor,
But clings to humility.
By putting himself beneath the world,
He helps sustain the world,
And safeguards its undifferentiated potential.

Sages know how to turn Tao into a practical means of power,
So great societies are careful to make efficient use of them.
