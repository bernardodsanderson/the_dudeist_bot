People are tied together through seduction.
Maude seduces the Dude by slipping off her robe,
Even though it was not hers to slip.

When the Dude submits to Maude,
He does so to compulsively fornicate.
When Maude submits to the Dude,
She does so because she wants a child.
The Dude will submit for fun and games,
Maude will submit to increase the chances of conception.
They’re both mixed up in this:
Laying one side against the other,
In bed with Jeffrey, Maudey,
Fabulous stuffing.

Therefore:
It is in everyone’s interest to pool their resources, trade information. Compeers, you know?
To achieve the modest tasks which are our charge,
We must resign to be tender.

*Tao Te Ching*

A great society should be like a lowland delta
Toward which all things flow downstream,
Commingling their potency.

Similarly,
It is by remaining receptive
That the submissive overcomes the dominating.
By attending to the base of things,
The receptive restores balance in the world.

It is in this way that
By submitting to the weak,
The strong can win their loyalty,
And by submitting to the strong
The weak can win their protection.

Thus, there is enormous power in placing oneself below.
If a relationship is mutually beneficial,
What does it matter who wears the crown?
