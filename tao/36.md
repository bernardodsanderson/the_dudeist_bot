Kill that car, your own car gets killed,
Mark it eight, you’re entering a world of pain,
Float to the sky, you’ll fall in the gutter,
Get a million dollars, they’ll cut off your johnson.

The Dude eventually overcomes the undude.
It’s like Lenin said: Look for the one who benefits.
Vanity is a weakness.
Modesty is a receptacle.

**Tao Te Ching**

That which is stretched too far will snap back.
That which uses too much power will become enfeebled.
That which is built up too high will topple over.
That which is overloaded with riches will soon be raided.

The weak will eventually overcome the strong—
This principle reveals the value of humility.
Just as fish who rise up to the surface are consumed,
Strength, when vaunted, is vanquished.
