Perfect calm seems imperfect,
But it’s calmer than you are.
Ample allowance may seem adequate,
But it owes money all over town.
Complicated cases make you lose your train of thought,
Especially when you’re anxious to get to the point.

In the same way:
The straightest cowboy can seem gay,
The biggest Lebowski can seem small,
And the most beautiful plan can seem fucked up.

Baths overcome bummers.
Relaxation overcomes rashes.
To help tie the room together,
Just take it easy, man.
Life will go on,
Even if it doesn’t start and stop at your convenience.

**Tao Te Ching**

The greatest accomplishment may appear ordinary,
But its greatness lies in its eternal utility.
The greatest abundance may appear unimpressive,
But its greatness lies in its inexhaustibility.

Similarly,
The straightest line may seem skewed,
The greatest intelligence may seem idiotic,
And the greatest communication may seem confounding.

Movement overcomes cold.
Stillness overcomes heat.
To help bring equilibrium to the world,
Just relax, take it easy,
And the world will flourish
Despite any of our efforts to understand it.
