People don’t need your sympathy,
They need their fucking johnsons,
The only reason they unrepentantly betray the public trust,
Is because their leaders have led them to believe in nossing.

Darkness warshes over,
And man’s days are as grass—
Blades cut down by blades.

Yet he who swings the sword,
Will only amputate his own ear.
And he who waves his piece around on the lanes
Will not make it to the next round robin.
Do you see what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass?
It kills your fucking karma.

*Tao Te Ching*

If people are no longer afraid to die,
Then death will be no deterrent.
They only commit capital crimes
When life becomes worse than death.

Nature is the great executioner
And death has long been its domain.
Assuming the role of the reaper
Ignores the double side of the blade.
Just like getting between a lumberjack and his lumber,
He who puts himself on the pathway
Is inclined to be cut down.
