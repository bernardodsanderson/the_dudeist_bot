Because the Dude lacks a job and business papers,
He can neither be hired nor fired,
He is never bumped into a higher tax bracket,
And his schedule remains always unposted.
Though The Eagles and lingonberry pancakes may seduce others,
The Dude favors Bob Dylan and burgers.
His sustenance is simple.

If you look for Dudeness you cannot see it.
And if you listen for Dudeness you cannot hear it.
But if you learn the way of the Dude,
You will hear the unspoken message here:
Oh, what a wonderful feeling!
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

*Tao Te Ching*

To one who can grasp the idea of Tao,
The entire world makes itself available,
So no harm can come to himâ€”
Only joy, abundance and contentment.

Though music and sweets may tantalize the typical passerby,
Tao is as transparent and tasteless as water,
And thus it is often ignored.

If you look for Tao you will not see it,
If you listen for Tao you will not hear it,
But if you learn to make use of it,
It will be of use to you always.
